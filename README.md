## Introduction

Git is a modern and widely used distributed version control system in the world. It is developed to manage projects with high speed and efficiency. The version control system allows us to monitor and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

---

## What is Git?

Git is an **open-source distributed version control system**. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to coordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

### Key Points:
- Git is the foundation of many services like **GitHub** and **GitLab**
- Can be used privately and publicly without other Git services
- Created by **Linus Torvalds in 2005** to develop Linux Kernel
- Used as an important distributed version-control tool for **DevOps**
- Easy to learn with fast performance
- Superior to other SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase

## Features of Git

### üîì Open Source
Git is an open-source tool released under the **GPL (General Public License)** license.

### üìà Scalable
Git is scalable, which means when the number of users increases, Git can easily handle such situations.

### üåê Distributed
One of Git's great features is that it is distributed. Instead of switching the project to another machine, we can create a **"clone"** of the entire repository. Every user has their own repository that contains the entire commit history of the project. Changes are stored on local repository and can be pushed to remote repository when necessary.

### üîí Security
Git is secure and uses **SHA1 (Secure Hash Function)** to name and identify objects within its repository. Files and commits are checked and retrieved by their checksum at the time of checkout. Once published, one cannot make changes to old versions.

### ‚ö° Speed
Git is very fast and can complete all tasks quickly. Most git operations are done on the local repository, providing huge speed advantages. Performance tests by Mozilla showed it was extremely fast compared to other VCSs. The core part of Git is written in **C**, which ignores runtime overheads associated with other high-level languages.

### üåø Support Non-linear Development
Git supports seamless branching and merging, which helps in visualizing and navigating non-linear development. A branch in Git represents a single commit, and the full branch structure can be constructed with the help of its parental commit.

### üîÄ Branching and Merging
Branching and merging are great features that make Git different from other SCM tools. Git allows creation of multiple branches without affecting each other.

**Branching Benefits:**
- Create separate branches for new modules
- Have production branches that always contain production-ready code
- Create demo branches for experiments
- Selective pushing to remote repositories

### üõ°Ô∏è Data Assurance
The Git data model ensures cryptographic integrity of every unit of the project. It provides a unique commit ID to every commit through SHA algorithm, allowing retrieval and updates by commit ID.

### üìã Staging Area
The Staging area is a unique functionality of Git that can be considered as a preview of the next commit. It's an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completion. Git uses a file called **index** instead of a dedicated staging directory.

### üßπ Maintain Clean History
Git facilitates with **Git Rebase**, which fetches the latest commits from the master branch and puts code on top of that, maintaining a clean project history.

---

## Benefits of Git

### ‚è∞ Saves Time
Git is lightning-fast technology. Each command takes only a few seconds to execute, saving significant time compared to logging into GitHub and navigating features.

### üîå Offline Working
One of the most important benefits is offline working support. Internet connectivity issues won't affect work since almost everything can be done locally, unlike other CVS systems like SVN.

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo Mistakes
Git provides undo options for almost everything, which can be a lifesaver when mistakes occur.

### üëÅÔ∏è Track Changes
Git provides exciting features such as **Diff**, **Log**, and **Status** that allow tracking changes, checking status, and comparing files or branches.

---

## Why Git?

### üîê Git Integrity
Git ensures security and integrity of content being version controlled. It uses checksums during transit and confirms information isn't lost by creating checksum values from file contents.

### üìä Trendy Version Control System
Git is the most widely used version control system with maximum projects among all version control systems. Its amazing workflow and features make it the preferred choice of developers.

### üíª Everything is Local
Almost all Git operations can be performed locally, eliminating the need for constant internet connectivity.

### ü§ù Collaborate on Public Projects
Many public projects are available on GitHub for collaboration, allowing developers to work with experienced professionals and improve programming skills.

### üíº Impress Recruiters
Mentioning Git and GitHub on resumes and sharing GitHub profiles can significantly increase hiring chances by showcasing skills and work.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **Git repository hosting service** that facilitates many features such as access control and collaboration. It provides a web-based graphical interface.

### Key Information:
- American company hosting source code in various programming languages
- Tracks changes made by programmers
- Offers distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality
- Provides collaboration features like bug tracking, feature requests, and task management

---

## Features of GitHub

GitHub is where programmers and designers collaborate, contribute, and fix bugs together. It hosts numerous open-source projects and code in various programming languages.

### Significant Features:
- **Collaboration**
- **Integrated issue and bug tracking**
- **Graphical representation of branches**
- **Git repositories hosting**
- **Project management**
- **Team management**
- **Code hosting**
- **Track and assign tasks**
- **Conversations**
- **Wikis**

---

## Benefits of GitHub

GitHub combines Git functionality with Hub services, including access controls and collaboration features.

### Key Benefits:
- **Easy contribution** to open-source projects
- **Excellent documentation** creation
- **Attract recruiters** by showcasing work
- **Public exposure** for your work
- **Version tracking** across code changes

---

## Understanding Git Components

### Open-source
Software released under specific licenses allowing users to use, modify, suggest changes, and clone code. Open-source software is typically cheaper, more flexible, and longer-lasting than proprietary alternatives.

### Control System
Tracks content by storing and providing services and features to users.

### Version Control System
Manages updates and changes like app versions due to bugs and feature additions. Supports branching where updated code can be merged with the main branch. Examples include Helix Core and Microsoft TFS.

### Distributed Version Control System
Code is stored both in central servers and in every developer's remote system. Developers change local repositories and create pull requests to merge changes in the central repository.

## Why is Git Needed?

When teams work on real-life projects, Git helps ensure:
- **No code conflicts** between developers
- **Version management** for changing project requirements
- **Code history preservation** with ability to revert to original code
- **Parallel development** through branching concepts

---

## Git Commands
